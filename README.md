# rethink: it's all in your head.
rethink is an experiment on making content for yourself and nobody else.

rethink is meant for the rawest form of expression.

rethink does not include any discoverability, markdown, or thought creation frontend.

your thoughts do not need to be comprehensible to anyone other than yourself.
